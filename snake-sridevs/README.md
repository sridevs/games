# Snake

This is a simple snake game.

## Scenario

The game is almost ready. However, this game doesn't end. There are no terminal conditions that have been written for this game yet.

The game is considered over when:

1. The Snake hits any of the edges of the viewport.

2. The Snake eats itself

The red color represents the head of the snake. The blue border represents the edges of the viewport. The rounded blue object represents food.


## Objective

Detect the end of the game based on the conditions above. Once the game is over, offer the user a chance to play the game again.

There is no need to implement a server.

## Suggestions

* Consider committing a TODO
* Commit regularly
* Use good commit messages
* Do not break existing functionality
* **Don't** use ```window.alert```
* Consider using ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port_of_your_choice>``` to host the game locally
